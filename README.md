# bike-counts-coupure

This is a repository with some of the code for the graphs that I made as an exercise to learn data processing and visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib. 

The data is taken from [*The Gent city website*](https://data.stad.gent/data/236).

There are three kind of graphs:
* Day charts: Time series where the amount of bikes each day are plotted. 
* Year charts: Comparison of the amount of bikes through the years
* Hour charts: Comparison of the amount of bikes during a day

You can find all plots in the [*Plots directory*](https://github.com/multavici/bike-counts-coupure/tree/master/plots)
